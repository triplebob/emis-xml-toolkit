# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in ClinXML, please report it **privately** using GitHub’s built‑in *Private Vulnerability Reporting* feature.

Use the **“Report a vulnerability”** button in the repository’s **Security** tab.

This ensures your report is delivered securely and handled promptly.  
Please **do not** open public issues for security concerns.

## Supported Versions
Security reports are accepted for the latest major release of ClinXML.

## Responsible Disclosure
All reports will be reviewed and investigated.  
If a fix is required, we will coordinate an appropriate disclosure timeline.
